# Memento Mori

> Memento mori (Latin): Remember Death

It is important to remember death, the only inevitability in one's life. 

# Project Statement
The objective is to create a digital, customizable, and exportable cross-platform interface that will allow users to visualize their life, or more specifically, their time in this universe. 

The interface will contain a grid of squares representing the weeks in one's life. The squares will be colored based on one criteria - whether one has already lived that week, or whether they are yet to live it.

Ideally, it should also have an "active" week which will represent the current week. A year or a month is too large of a time slot to allocate to each square, while a day is too small. A week provides an optimal length of time to visualize and act upon. 

The philosophical merit will be the constant reminder of one's mortality and the limited time. 

The commercial merit is that many people are beginning to engage in philosophical discussions lately. Philosophy has always been an active subject of discussion and will continue to do so. In addition, although abstract philosophical thought experiments are fun and engaging, most people tend to latch onto a physical artifact or symbol as a constant reminder of their philosophical convictions.
